## What it is

`cloudor` has the simple goal to make cloud computing simple. 

Running applications on the cloud can be as easy as entering a command, without making compromises of
flexibility and capability. `cloudor` empowers the user to freely deploy code not only in different regions with different hardware settings, 
but also from a variety of cloud vendors.
