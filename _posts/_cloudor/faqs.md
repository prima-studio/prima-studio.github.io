# FAQs

### I sometimes get errors like "exceeding the resource limit". What does that mean?

This is the hard quota applied from cloud vendors to `cloudor`. We are actively extending our limit but at the same time please try the service with another region or vendor or a later time.

### How can we upload our own input data?

Please see [this examples](./input_output.md)

### Do you store the input and output data?

No, we do not store the data uploaded to our "bucket" permanently. The data is deleted within 48 hours after the job is finished.

### What are the new features on the TODO list? 

* More vendor/region support
* Allow users to provide their own cloud storage for intermediate data transfer.
* Multi-node support
* Allow users to reserve a node for their own usage

### Is there a way to use our own cloud credentials?

Not at the moment. But we'd like to add this option. Please contact us.
